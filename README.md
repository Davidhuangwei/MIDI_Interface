MIDI_Interface
==============

MIDI interface for ultrasonic phased array control, intended for use with Behringer BCF2000 MIDI Interface.
Further updates still to come, for now all that this does is read MIDI commands and store them in generic variables.

TO DO:
==============

1. Create documentation
2. Update variable names to correspond to TFM algorithm
3. Gather variables together in LabView project
